# Vora Compiler

The Vora compiler is responsible for transforming Vora source code into executable code. It is built using LLVM as the backend for code generation and optimization.

## Directory Structure

- `src/` - Compiler source code
  - Lexical analysis (tokenization)
  - Syntax analysis (parsing)
  - Semantic analysis
  - Code generation
- `include/` - Public header files
- `tests/` - Compiler unit tests and integration tests

## Building

Instructions for building the compiler will be added here.

## Usage

Instructions for using the compiler will be added here.
